# Comfy 

Comfy is a lightweight Node.js interface for [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) that utilizes [Mikael Rogers'](https://github.com/mikeal) excellent [request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) library.  In terms of interface it is heavily influenced from [Pedro Landeiro's](landeiro) [PJsonCouch](https://github.com/landeiro/PJsonCouch).

The reason Comfy came into existence, is simply that Mikael's library does such a good job of HTTP request handling for Node, that is just doesn't make sense to use the raw HTTP client...
